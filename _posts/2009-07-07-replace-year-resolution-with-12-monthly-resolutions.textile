title: Replace New Year's resolution with 12 monthly resolutions
author: Paolo Dona
---

Those of you who are close to me know I got this year into a kind of "monthly resolutions":http://www.everydaysystems.com/podcast/episode.php?id=16 challenge. I've been doing this for 6 months now so I wanna take you through my progresses.

h4. What's a monthly resolution?

Instead of having a big new year's resolution, which I inevitably failed to achieve year after year, I decided to break down my goals into small and more manageable monthly bits. The base line is: stick with one and only one goal for a month, after which chances are it's become a habit and you can move on the next thing.
This is a quite clever way to approach resolutions as it puts almost no pressure on you and can lead to good life changing habits.

Here my resolutions so far:

* January: Set my 3 Most Important Tasks each morning.
* February: Become a early riser.
* March: Eat better.
* April: Give up coffee.
* May: Cycle to work every day.
* June: Play my guitar half an hour a day. 

h4. So, how did it go?

I'm quite happy with the results even if I've not been 100% diligent. Some resolutions worked better than others but I can say this is the first time in my life I've been able to change my habits so effectively.

h4. January: Set the 3 most important task for the day.

This involves identifing 3 must do for the day, and write them down on a piece of paper to carry in your wallet all day long. They don't need to be big things, just think of them as small steps towards your long term goals (eg: call that guy to help you out on you project, call the bank to set up a merchant account and so on).
It's a lot easier to achieve goals when you plan them in advance, otherwise you risk to live your day in confusion and constantly pulled away from your priorities by all sorts of events. 

I stuck with this habit for 2 solid months and then lost it a bit, definitely one of the most challenging habits of the whole lot. I'll probably try to write the MITs for a day down the night before and see if it gets easier.

h4. February: Become an early riser 

The best results have come from getting up early. I wanted to do this for a long time because there are so many things I want to do and always to little time, and I didn't want to sacrifice the lovely evenings I usually spend with my girlfriend or playing guitar.

To start with I decided to wake up at exaclty the same time every morning. Then I bought a "bodyclock":http://www.lumie.com/shop/products/bodyclock-starter-25 and started waking up 15 minutes earlier every week and settled for 6:30am.

I'm now constantly getting up at 6:30 during the week and can easily work for 1 hour and a half on projects of mine before going to work.
It's amazing how a powerful productivity booster this is. I've set up a morning routine (wake up/shower/breakfast/work) that makes me feel proud of my day even before starting it out!

h4. March: Eat slightly better

Plain and easy: eat at least 1 fruit for breakfast and 1 vegetable serving for dinner. Every day. If you manage to buy fruit and salad while at the grocery store, that's pretty easy to achieve. I love apples and bananas for breakfast, and **la bai cai** (Hot and sour cabbage) plus rice for dinner.

h4. April: Give up coffee

I do not like coffee, and I realized the 3/4 cups of coffee I day I used to have were only useful to keep me awake. I didn't enjoy them. 
And I thought, why do I feel sleepy in the first place? Am I eating well enough? Am I having enough sleep?
Programmer's culture seems to worship coffee to an extent that I do not really understand. In a world where technology and progress should make our life easier and less stressful, we always worry about performing at a faster pace. Giving up coffee is just a reflection of my inner pace change. Take it easy and enjoy the jouney.

h4. May: Cycle to work every day

I'm in my underpants in front of the mirror, staring at my pale body. I'm not fat, but let's be honest, I'm definitely not fit. All these 10 years of programming are really showing off, and the fact that my heart pumps hard whenever I walk for more than 10 minutes should be a clear warning.
So to start it easy I just bought a "bike":http://lh6.ggpht.com/_aGNKixInRkE/SlGrlune9DI/AAAAAAAAGHc/_VegBxaL0Zc/s800/se-draft-lite-2009-singlespeed-bike.jpg and got rid of my monthly subway pass. That's feasible as my workplace is only 3 miles away from my house, making it a perfect morning ride to work. As a nice side effect in 3 months I'll cover the investment and start saving money.

h4. June: Play guitar half an hour a day

As some of you may know, I used to be a guitar player. I was in a successful little rock band, and at some point of my life I was almost tempted to keep doing that for a living. Well, being now involved in software develpment it's pretty clear I gave up.
It's a shame I'm not playing on a regular basis though, because playing it's a very engaging and exciting hobby. 

After 10 years of complete inactivity, my previous band members decided to organize "the farewell gig we never had", so I'm kind of forced to play every day and sharpen my skills back!
10 songs a day kick the programmer away! 
Here the website of my former band: "http://www.rambass.com":http://www.rambass.com (guess which one is me), I'll be playing in Italy on the 30th of July.

h4. Bottom line

I'm not a very strong-willed person, but these monthly resolutions are really shaping new habits I'm very proud of. If you feel there's something you'd like to change about yourself, try this method, and I guarantee your goals will be a lot easier to achieve.
