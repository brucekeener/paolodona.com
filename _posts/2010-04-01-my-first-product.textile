title: "My First Product: An Online Service To Manage Language Schools"

As you probably know I've worked in the software development industry for about 10 years now. I've covered different roles such as developer, teacher, consultant, and product manager. 

In the past year I realised I'm not only interested in the technical side of software development; Over time I've become more and more interested in all the other activities related to the creation of a product.

As any other software developer, I have started and abandoned over two dozen projects, giving up every time I came across something more exciting, and this started getting on my nerves.

How come I've succesfully worked on a moltitude of projects and products for my employers and customers but I've never completely owned a product? I strongly feel I've missed whole point of my efforts. 

It's important to me to prove I can create something meaningful and useful, something good, that people are willing to pay for. 

I want to understand why certain things work and others don't. I want to understand where the real value of a product is, no matter how complex or interesting the underlying technology.

The opportunity to create a product from scratch struck me about a year ago, when a language school here in London asked me to build a new system to manage their students. 

I've taken this chance to get exposed to the whole lifecycle of a product, and in the meanwhile waste a bit of my free time.

So far the journey has been quite interesting as I've been involved in:

* doing market research
* creating a business case, outlining costs and profitability
* setting up PPC marketing campaigns
* learning to optimize landing pages for conversion 
* learning how to do email marketing
* understanding the business domain
* supporting customers
* managing people across different timezones ^1^

^(1)^ I've not been alone through all this, as I needed the help of a few programmers, designers and copywriters to actually bring something to life while preserving my habit of sleeping eight hours a day :-)

The project is a software-as-a-service that helps schools manage their classes, attendances, payments, documents and so on. 

It's still in its infancy but it's up and running and currently used by a few schools. 

You can take a look at it at "http://www.niftyschool.com":http://www.niftyschool.com. 

I'd love to know what you think, any comments or suggestions are more than welcome!

Wherever my career might take me, I'm sure this experiment will be a valuable lesson in better understanding the web product business. 

And just in case you're wondering: No, it's not profitable yet.

PS: My colleagues might find the UI quite familiar. Don't complain, it's been borrowed from previus work done at "SeeSaw":http://www.seesaw.it.
