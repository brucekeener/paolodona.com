  <h1><a href="/2009/07/07/replace-year-resolution-with-12-monthly-resolutions.html">Replace New Year's resolution with 12 monthly resolutions</a></h1>
  <p>Those of you who are close to me know that I got into a kind of <a href="http://www.everydaysystems.com/podcast/episode.php?id=16">monthly resolutions</a> challenge this year. I&#8217;ve been doing this for 6 months now so I wanna take you through my progress.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s a monthly resolution?</h4>
<p>Instead of having a big new year&#8217;s resolution, which I inevitably failed to achieve year after year, I decided to break down my goals into small and more manageable monthly bits. The base line is: Stick with one and only one goal for a month, after which chances are it will become a habit, enabling you to move on to the next thing.<br />
This is a quite clever way of approaching resolutions, as it puts almost no pressure on you and can lead to good life-changing habits.</p>
<p>Here are my resolutions so far:</p>
<ul>
	<li>January: Set my 3 Most Important Tasks (MITs) each morning.</li>
	<li>February: Become a early riser.</li>
	<li>March: Eat better.</li>
	<li>April: Give up coffee.</li>
	<li>May: Cycle to work every day.</li>
	<li>June: Play my guitar half-an-hour a day.</li>
</ul>
<h4>So, how has it been going?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m quite happy with the results, even if I&#8217;ve not been 100% diligent. Some resolutions have worked better than others. But I can say this is the first time in my life I&#8217;ve been able to change my habits so effectively.</p>
<h4>January: Set the 3 MITs for the day.</h4>
<p>This involves identifying 3 must-do tasks for the day and writing them down on a piece of paper to carry in your wallet all day long. They don&#8217;t need to be big things. Just think of them as small steps towards your long-term goals (eg: call that guy to help you out on you project, call the bank to set up a merchant account, and so on).<br />
It&#8217;s a lot easier to achieve goals when you plan them in advance, otherwise you risk having a confused day and being constantly pulled away from your priorities by all sorts of events.</p>
<p>I stuck with this habit for 2 solid months and then lost it a bit, definitely one of the most challenging habits of all to form. I&#8217;ll probably try to write down the MITs for a day the night before and see if it gets any easier.</p>

<h4>February: Become an early riser</h4>
<p>The best results have come from getting up early. I had wanted to do this for a long time because there are so many things I want to do and always too little time. Also, I didn&#8217;t want to sacrifice the lovely evenings I usually spend with my girlfriend or playing guitar.</p>
<p>To begin, I decided to wake up at exactly the same time every morning. Then I bought a <a href="http://www.lumie.com/shop/products/bodyclock-starter-25">bodyclock</a> and started waking up 15 minutes earlier every week, finally settling for 6:30am.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now constantly getting up at 6:30 during the week and can easily work for an hour and a half on projects of mine before going to work.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how powerful a productivity booster this is. I&#8217;ve established a morning routine (wake up/shower/breakfast/work) that makes me feel proud of my day even before it has even really begun!</p>

<h4>March: Eat slightly better</h4>
<p>Plain and simple: Eat at least 1 piece of fruit for breakfast and 1 serving of vegetables for dinner. Every day. If you manage to buy fruit and salad while at the grocery store, that&#8217;s pretty easy to achieve. I love apples and bananas for breakfast, and <b>la bai cai</b> (hot and sour cabbage) plus rice for dinner.</p>

<h4>April: Give up coffee</h4>
<p>I don&#8217;t like coffee, and I realized that the 3-to-4 cups of coffee I used to drink a day were only useful for keeping me awake. I didn&#8217;t enjoy them. <br />
And I thought, why do I feel sleepy in the first place? Am I eating well enough? Am I getting enough sleep?<br />
Programmer culture seems to worship coffee to an extent that I do not really understand. In a world in which technology and progress should make our life easier and less stressful, we always worry about performing at a faster pace. Giving up coffee is just a reflection of my inner pace change. Take it easy and enjoy the journey.</p>

<h4>May: Cycle to work every day</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m in my underpants in front of the mirror, staring at my pale body. I&#8217;m not fat, but let&#8217;s be honest, I&#8217;m definitely not fit. All these 10 years of programming are really starting to show, and the fact that my heart pumps hard whenever I walk for more than 10 minutes should be a clear warning.<br />
So to start off nice and easy I just bought a <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_aGNKixInRkE/SlGrlune9DI/AAAAAAAAGHc/_VegBxaL0Zc/s800/se-draft-lite-2009-singlespeed-bike.jpg">bike</a> and got rid of my monthly underground pass. That&#8217;s feasible, as my workplace is only 3 miles away from my house, making it a perfect morning ride to work. A nice added benefit is that Iâ€™ll cover the investment in 3 months and start saving money after that.</p>
<h4>June: Play guitar half an hour a day</h4>
<p>As some of you may know, I used to be a guitar player. I was in a successful little rock band, and at some point of my life I was almost tempted to keep doing that for a living. I Well, now with being involved in software development, is should pretty clear that I gave up.<br />
It&#8217;s a shame I&#8217;m not playing on a regular basis, though, because it&#8217;s a very engaging and exciting hobby.</p>
<p>After 10 years of complete inactivity, my previous band members decided to organize &#8220;the farewell gig we never had&#8221;, so I&#8217;m kind of forced to play every day and sharpen my skills again!<br />
Ten songs a day keep the programmer away! <br />
Here&#8217;s the website of my former band: <a href="http://www.rambass.com">http://www.rambass.com</a> (guess which one is me), I&#8217;ll be playing in Italy on July 31.</p>

<h4>Bottom line</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m not a very strong-willed person, but these monthly resolutions are really shaping new habits I&#8217;m very proud of. If you feel there&#8217;s something you&#8217;d like to change about yourself, try this method, and I guarantee your goals will be a lot easier to achieve.</p>
