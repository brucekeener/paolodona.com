  <h1><a href="/2010/11/17/status-update.html">Status Update November 2010</a></h1>
  <p class="meta">published on Nov 17, 2010 by Paolo Dona</p>
  <p>Hey guys, I haven&#8217;t posted anything in a long while, and thought to drop you a quick update. Highlight: I&#8217;m alive and doing well, you can skip the rest :)</p>
<p>So, what have I been up to during the past months? I&#8217;m extremely busy on an interesting project: a marketing communication platform that incorporates multiple channels: email, sms, social media + <span class="caps">CRM</span> aspects and a really kick ass reporting engine.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re dealing with massive volumes here and there are challenging technical problems that need to be solved. Luckily enough I&#8217;m supported by great engineers and I&#8217;m sure this will be a huge success.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m spending half of my time in Manchester with this new team and for the first time in my life I have to deal with <span class="caps">PHP</span> &amp; new technologies like MongoDB etc. To be honest I&#8217;m not doing the programming myself, but it&#8217;s interesting to see the difference between these technologies and the Ruby/MySQL world I&#8217;m so used to.</p>
<p>At the same time, the quest to conquer the world of language schools continues with my <a href="http://www.niftyschool.com">NiftySchool.com</a>. This is really a humbling experience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working really hard on this baby to make it the best software a language school can buy. You need dedication, patience and a pretty much unlimited amount of willpower to keep helping your customers and understand what is really useful, day after day after day. After day. But I love it and I&#8217;m not going to stop.</p>
<p>What I have failed to understand in the past, is the level of sacrifice and dedication needed to make your product succeed. Many can write a piece of software, few can suffer long enough to see it flourish. Few are able to say no to all of the distractions preventing them to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Early mornings, late evenings, weekends, any available moment is spent tweaking, improving and giving our schools our best.</p>
<p>We already introduced a number of interesting features such as ability to take online payments, automated document generation, taking pictures of the students via webcam, contact management, alerts and so on. On top of that full support for the American market and visa handling.</p>
<p>The roadmap is filled with interesting and useful stuff and we can&#8217;t wait to impress our customers and get new schools onboard.</p>
<p>I dreamed about having a product for a long while, and now, even if slowly, the dream is becoming true.</p>
<p>This is pretty much it. I have very little time for anything else now&#8230; hope you&#8217;re doing well too. If you want feel free to get in touch.<br />

  <p>Hey guys, just a quick one. <br />

  <h1><a href="/2010/04/01/my-first-product.html">My First Product: An Online Service To Manage Language Schools</a></h1>
  <p class="meta">published on Apr 01, 2010 by Paolo Dona</p>
  <p>As you probably know I&#8217;ve worked in the software development industry for about 10 years now. I&#8217;ve covered different roles such as developer, teacher, consultant, and product manager.</p>
<p>In the past year I realised I&#8217;m not only interested in the technical side of software development; Over time I&#8217;ve become more and more interested in all the other activities related to the creation of a product.</p>
<p>As any other software developer, I have started and abandoned over two dozen projects, giving up every time I came across something more exciting, and this started getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>How come I&#8217;ve succesfully worked on a multitude of projects and products for my employers and customers but I&#8217;ve never completely owned a product? I strongly feel I&#8217;ve missed the whole point of my efforts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to me to prove I can create something meaningful and useful, something good, that people are willing to pay for.</p>
<p>I want to understand why certain things work and others don&#8217;t. I want to understand where the real value of a product is, no matter how complex or interesting the underlying technology.</p>
<p>The opportunity to create a product from scratch struck me about a year ago, when a language school here in London asked me to build a new system to manage their students.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken this chance to get exposed to the whole lifecycle of a product, and in the meanwhile waste a bit of my free time.</p>
<p>So far the journey has been quite interesting as I&#8217;ve been involved in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>doing market research</li>
	<li>creating a business case, outlining costs and profitability</li>
	<li>setting up <span class="caps">PPC</span> marketing campaigns</li>
	<li>learning to optimize landing pages for conversion</li>
	<li>learning how to do email marketing</li>
	<li>understanding the business domain</li>
	<li>supporting customers</li>
	<li>managing people across different timezones <sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><sup>(1)</sup> I&#8217;ve not been alone through all this, as I needed the help of a few programmers, designers and copywriters to actually bring something to life while preserving my habit of sleeping eight hours a day :-)</p>
<p>The project is a software-as-a-service that helps schools manage their classes, attendances, payments, documents and so on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still in its infancy but it&#8217;s up and running and currently used by a few schools.</p>
<p>You can take a look at it at <a href="http://www.niftyschool.com">http://www.niftyschool.com</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know what you think, any comments or suggestions are more than welcome!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.niftyschool.com"><img src="http://www.paolodona.com/images/posts/niftyschool.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Wherever my career may take me, I&#8217;m sure this experiment will be a valuable lesson in better understanding the web product business.</p>
<p>And just in case you&#8217;re wondering: No, it&#8217;s not profitable yet. <br />
And again no, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1917-i-quit-my-job-applause">I&#8217;m not going to quit my job</a>.</p>
<p>PS: My colleagues might find the UI quite familiar. Don&#8217;t complain, it&#8217;s been borrowed from previous work done at <a href="http://www.seesaw.it">SeeSaw</a>.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/09/03/suggestions-for-your-monthly-resolutions.html">Suggestions for your monthly resolutions</a></h1>
  <p class="meta">published on Sep 03, 2009 by Paolo Dona</p>
  <p>As you know, I&#8217;m into <a href="http://paolodona.com/2009/07/07/replace-year-resolution-with-12-monthly-resolutions.html">monthly resolutions</a>.<br />
I want to find out new goals as this way to improve my lifestyle has proven really successful and rewarding.</p>
<p>Here you&#8217;ll find a bunch of ideas from which I&#8217;ll choose my September&#8217;s resolution:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Track personal finances and expenses</li>
	<li>Do not drink Soda</li>
	<li>Always cook my own lunch and bring it to work (as opposed to buy it)</li>
	<li>Relax properly every day (eg: 10 minutes of pure rest or breathing exercises)</li>
	<li>10 minutes of walking/running a day (maybe using my <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/paolo.dona/5fingers">fivefingers</a>)</li>
	<li>Check email twice a day at regular times</li>
	<li>Work on my own projects every Saturday morning</li>
	<li>Declutter the house 10 minutes a day</li>
	<li>Have a basic weekly dinner program (so that I don&#8217;t randomly eat junk food)</li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;re just Ideas and I&#8217;ve got only four months left this year so I&#8217;m pretty sure I won&#8217;t be able to do them all, but they can be inspirational for you as well. Once you&#8217;ve compiled your own list you need to go through it and ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What&#8217;s the habit which can have the most impact on my life?</li>
	<li>Which habit would I be the most proud of?</li>
	<li>Which habit would solve a behaviour which I consider an issue now?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answers to these questions are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Most impact: <strong>Work on my projects every Saturday morning</strong> as I dream to run my own online products in the future.</li>
	<li>Most proud of: <strong>10 minutes of walking/running</strong> as could help me to get started with regular exercise.</li>
	<li>Solve an issue: <strong>Check email only twice a day</strong> as I feel I&#8217;m too distracted and need to focus more on getting my stuff done instead of being always &#8216;email driven&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to go with the &#8220;Email twice a day&#8221; resolution, as I&#8217;ve been fascinated by:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071024171340/http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_pmarca_guid.html">Marc Andreessen&#8217;s guide to personal productivity</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/03/22/how-to-check-e-mail-twice-a-day-or-once-every-10-days/">Tim Ferris: How to Check E-mail Twice a Day or Once Every 10 Days</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>What&#8217;s <em>your</em> September&#8217;s resolution?</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/08/28/tips-to-reduce-eye-strain.html">Two Tips To Reduce Eye Strain</a></h1>
  <p class="meta">published on Aug 28, 2009 by Paolo Dona</p>
  <p>In the past couple of months my eyesight has worsened quickly. <br />
It has worsened to the point that I now need to wear glasses on a daily basis. I know this doesn&#8217;t sound too serius as there are millions of people wearing glasses or contact lenses but I consider it quite bad after 30 year of perfect eyesight. The worst thing about it is that I now get tired easily and I suffer from occasional headaches.</p>
<p>I just want to share a couple of tips which are helping me to reduce eye strain:</p>
<h2>1. Use <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/nocturne/nocturne">Nocturne</a></h2>
<p>Looking at the computer screen is like looking at a light bulb. The less white light hit your eyes, the better. I used to use editors with a black background but there are a couple of applications that do not support color customization (Word, Excel and the like).</p>
<p>Nocturne is a little application that invert the colors on your screen, so that white becomes black and viceversa. I can assure this is a lot easier on your eyes and you&#8217;ll feel the difference if you just try it for an hour.</p>
<h2>2. Use <a href="http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/">AntiRSI</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;m used to look at close objects and my optometrist suggested to regularly look at things far away, and of course I forget to.<br />
This software (Anti Repetitive Strain Injury) remind you to take short breaks every now and then, to make sure you don&#8217;t stare at the computer screen for too long without giving your eyes the chance to rest.</p>
<p>AntiRSI is smart enough to understand if you&#8217;ve already taken a break, monitoring your mouse and keyboard activity.</p>
<p>These tools are only for Mac, please feel free to reply with Linux/Windows equivalents.</p>
