  <h1><a href="/2010/11/17/status-update.html">Status Update November 2010</a></h1>
  <p class="meta">published on Nov 17, 2010 by Paolo Dona</p>
  <p>Hey guys, I haven&#8217;t posted anything in a long while, and thought to drop you a quick update. Highlight: I&#8217;m alive and doing well, you can skip the rest :)</p>
<p>So, what have I been up to during the past months? I&#8217;m extremely busy on an interesting project: a marketing communication platform that incorporates multiple channels: email, sms, social media + <span class="caps">CRM</span> aspects and a really kick ass reporting engine.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re dealing with massive volumes here and there are challenging technical problems that need to be solved. Luckily enough I&#8217;m supported by great engineers and I&#8217;m sure this will be a huge success.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m spending half of my time in Manchester with this new team and for the first time in my life I have to deal with <span class="caps">PHP</span> &amp; new technologies like MongoDB etc. To be honest I&#8217;m not doing the programming myself, but it&#8217;s interesting to see the difference between these technologies and the Ruby/MySQL world I&#8217;m so used to.</p>
<p>At the same time, the quest to conquer the world of language schools continues with my <a href="http://www.niftyschool.com">NiftySchool.com</a>. This is really a humbling experience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working really hard on this baby to make it the best software a language school can buy. You need dedication, patience and a pretty much unlimited amount of willpower to keep helping your customers and understand what is really useful, day after day after day. After day. But I love it and I&#8217;m not going to stop.</p>
<p>What I have failed to understand in the past, is the level of sacrifice and dedication needed to make your product succeed. Many can write a piece of software, few can suffer long enough to see it flourish. Few are able to say no to all of the distractions preventing them to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Early mornings, late evenings, weekends, any available moment is spent tweaking, improving and giving our schools our best.</p>
<p>We already introduced a number of interesting features such as ability to take online payments, automated document generation, taking pictures of the students via webcam, contact management, alerts and so on. On top of that full support for the American market and visa handling.</p>
<p>The roadmap is filled with interesting and useful stuff and we can&#8217;t wait to impress our customers and get new schools onboard.</p>
<p>I dreamed about having a product for a long while, and now, even if slowly, the dream is becoming true.</p>
<p>This is pretty much it. I have very little time for anything else now&#8230; hope you&#8217;re doing well too. If you want feel free to get in touch.<br />

  <p>Hey guys, just a quick one. <br />
<a href="http://www.wgcomunicazione.it">WG Comunicazione</a>, a digital agency based in northern Italy, has just published an article about <a href="http://www.niftyschool.com">NiftySchool</a>, the online tool I created to manage language schools.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2010/04/01/my-first-product.html">My First Product: An Online Service To Manage Language Schools</a></h1>
  <p class="meta">published on Apr 01, 2010 by Paolo Dona</p>
  <p>As you probably know I&#8217;ve worked in the software development industry for about 10 years now. I&#8217;ve covered different roles such as developer, teacher, consultant, and product manager.</p>
<p>In the past year I realised I&#8217;m not only interested in the technical side of software development; Over time I&#8217;ve become more and more interested in all the other activities related to the creation of a product.</p>
<p>As any other software developer, I have started and abandoned over two dozen projects, giving up every time I came across something more exciting, and this started getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>How come I&#8217;ve succesfully worked on a multitude of projects and products for my employers and customers but I&#8217;ve never completely owned a product? I strongly feel I&#8217;ve missed the whole point of my efforts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to me to prove I can create something meaningful and useful, something good, that people are willing to pay for.</p>
<p>I want to understand why certain things work and others don&#8217;t. I want to understand where the real value of a product is, no matter how complex or interesting the underlying technology.</p>
<p>The opportunity to create a product from scratch struck me about a year ago, when a language school here in London asked me to build a new system to manage their students.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken this chance to get exposed to the whole lifecycle of a product, and in the meanwhile waste a bit of my free time.</p>
<p>So far the journey has been quite interesting as I&#8217;ve been involved in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>doing market research</li>
	<li>creating a business case, outlining costs and profitability</li>
	<li>setting up <span class="caps">PPC</span> marketing campaigns</li>
	<li>learning to optimize landing pages for conversion</li>
	<li>learning how to do email marketing</li>
	<li>understanding the business domain</li>
	<li>supporting customers</li>
	<li>managing people across different timezones <sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><sup>(1)</sup> I&#8217;ve not been alone through all this, as I needed the help of a few programmers, designers and copywriters to actually bring something to life while preserving my habit of sleeping eight hours a day :-)</p>
<p>The project is a software-as-a-service that helps schools manage their classes, attendances, payments, documents and so on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still in its infancy but it&#8217;s up and running and currently used by a few schools.</p>
<p>You can take a look at it at <a href="http://www.niftyschool.com">http://www.niftyschool.com</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know what you think, any comments or suggestions are more than welcome!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.niftyschool.com"><img src="http://www.paolodona.com/images/posts/niftyschool.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Wherever my career may take me, I&#8217;m sure this experiment will be a valuable lesson in better understanding the web product business.</p>
<p>And just in case you&#8217;re wondering: No, it&#8217;s not profitable yet. <br />
And again no, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1917-i-quit-my-job-applause">I&#8217;m not going to quit my job</a>.</p>
<p>PS: My colleagues might find the UI quite familiar. Don&#8217;t complain, it&#8217;s been borrowed from previous work done at <a href="http://www.seesaw.it">SeeSaw</a>.</p>

  <p class="meta">published on Sep 13, 2009 by Paolo Dona</p>
  <p>There are days in which you feel invicible. It&#8217;s great when you&#8217;re excited about a goal, a new topic, or when you have an inspiring chat with a friend and the impossible seems achievable. During these days we&#8217;re confident in our ideas, we can influence people and get them excited, and we can carry a special emotional power that lights up our time and makes us feel alive and positive about our future.</p>
<p>There are other days in which laziness and routine just take over. We don&#8217;t feel like working and we&#8217;re uninterested in putting effort in even the simplest tasks. There are times in which we lack passion and drive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand this is normal. For a long time I felt guilty for feeling tired or lazy or not so interested in what I considered life goals of mine. And most of the time I just was too tired or overwhelmed. <br />
Our mood depends on how tired we are, on our diet, on our expectations, and another million things. So please do expect to have up and down periods.</p>
<p>Whilst I do not want to push against my natural mood swings, I&#8217;ve discovered a bunch of tips that help me overcome these moments and get back to a great excited, positive and active mood:</p>
<h2>Hang out with inspiring people</h2>
<p>Favour funny, exciting, interesting people over negative ones! Do ask them to hang out with you, invite them for dinner, host them if you can. Sharing positive attitude is vital to keep you motivated. Avoid people who tend to complain too much, or have no desire to improve and live life at its fullest.</p>
<h2>Read inspiring books</h2>
<p>There are books who can inspire and improve our willing to chase our dreams. Keep them and reread them whenever necessary!<br />
I tend to read inspiring books for 10/15 minutes after breakfast. That really set the right pace for the day and make me focus on the important things.</p>
<h2>Rest, Rest, Rest</h2>
<p>There are people who achieve success at 20, others at 50. If you&#8217;re tired and are not</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/09/03/suggestions-for-your-monthly-resolutions.html">Suggestions for your monthly resolutions</a></h1>
  <p class="meta">published on Sep 03, 2009 by Paolo Dona</p>
  <p>As you know, I&#8217;m into <a href="http://paolodona.com/2009/07/07/replace-year-resolution-with-12-monthly-resolutions.html">monthly resolutions</a>.<br />
I want to find out new goals as this way to improve my lifestyle has proven really successful and rewarding.</p>
<p>Here you&#8217;ll find a bunch of ideas from which I&#8217;ll choose my September&#8217;s resolution:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Track personal finances and expenses</li>
	<li>Do not drink Soda</li>
	<li>Always cook my own lunch and bring it to work (as opposed to buy it)</li>
	<li>Relax properly every day (eg: 10 minutes of pure rest or breathing exercises)</li>
	<li>10 minutes of walking/running a day (maybe using my <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/paolo.dona/5fingers">fivefingers</a>)</li>
	<li>Check email twice a day at regular times</li>
	<li>Work on my own projects every Saturday morning</li>
	<li>Declutter the house 10 minutes a day</li>
	<li>Have a basic weekly dinner program (so that I don&#8217;t randomly eat junk food)</li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;re just Ideas and I&#8217;ve got only four months left this year so I&#8217;m pretty sure I won&#8217;t be able to do them all, but they can be inspirational for you as well. Once you&#8217;ve compiled your own list you need to go through it and ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What&#8217;s the habit which can have the most impact on my life?</li>
	<li>Which habit would I be the most proud of?</li>
	<li>Which habit would solve a behaviour which I consider an issue now?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answers to these questions are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Most impact: <strong>Work on my projects every Saturday morning</strong> as I dream to run my own online products in the future.</li>
	<li>Most proud of: <strong>10 minutes of walking/running</strong> as could help me to get started with regular exercise.</li>
	<li>Solve an issue: <strong>Check email only twice a day</strong> as I feel I&#8217;m too distracted and need to focus more on getting my stuff done instead of being always &#8216;email driven&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to go with the &#8220;Email twice a day&#8221; resolution, as I&#8217;ve been fascinated by:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071024171340/http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_pmarca_guid.html">Marc Andreessen&#8217;s guide to personal productivity</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/03/22/how-to-check-e-mail-twice-a-day-or-once-every-10-days/">Tim Ferris: How to Check E-mail Twice a Day or Once Every 10 Days</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>What&#8217;s <em>your</em> September&#8217;s resolution?</p>
